# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

await contract.sendToMany("Polygon", "0x7C8C523e59CA45325bAdBD8C97F47bEdAEd651E1", ["0x03555aA97c7Ece30Afe93DAb67224f3adA79A60f", "0xC165CbEc276C26c57F1b1Cbc499109AbeCbA4474", "0x23f5536D2C7a8ffE66C385F9f7e53a5C86F53bD1"], "aUSDC", 6000000, {value: "100000000000000000"})
