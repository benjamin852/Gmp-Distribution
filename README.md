# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

await contract.sendToMany("Polygon", "0x06680e54dAa34127932537C929Bcf9685b460b01", ["0x312dba807EAE77f01EF3dd21E885052f8F617c5B"], "aUSDC", 5985479, {value: "100000000000000000"})
